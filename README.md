# DailyProgrammingTasks
A collection of small quick programming tasks and algorithm tests to practice interview problems. Prompts provided by founders@dailycodingproblem.com

### Languages Used
Currently the majority of the prompts will be answered in Python. This is due to the fact that the majority of my classes at Oregon State are utalizing the language, and I thought it a good idea to practice in such a personally underutalized language.

### What to Expect
Each program has their own unique subdirectory. Within this directory, you will find a prompt.txt which explains the basic concept of the programming challenge or algorithm. Included is a <prompt>.py file (or any other language I might use in future for fun) which you will be able to test a predefined test by simply calling the file, or by providing an argument in the CLI the program will run a custom test based on the provided arguments.
